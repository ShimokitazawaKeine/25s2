## Statistical Computing

### Population and Example

**1. Population**

data corresponding to the entire collection of units that we are study on.

**2. Sample**

a subset of the population.

> In most studies, optaining the whole population is difficult. That is why we use the **sample**.

### Parameters and Statistics

**1. Parameter** is a number that describe a population.

    It is normally **fixed**. (and usually unknown).

**2. Statistic** is a number that describe a sample.

    It is a variable that **varies** from sample to samle.
